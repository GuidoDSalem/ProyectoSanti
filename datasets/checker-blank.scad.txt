// READ Polygon troubleshooting and be consistent in making the faces with clockwise sequences of points, always looking at each face from "outside" to avoid 2-manifold errors.

// VARIABLES
size=15; // radius of checker
k=0; // increment for edge notches

// MODULES
// this is a very elongated tetrahedron
