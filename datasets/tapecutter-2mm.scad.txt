// Tape Cutter

// The mail truck has a red and blue stripe with white between them and the truck itself is white.

// I was able to find red and blue fabric tape (duct tape) at my local craft store (in addition to other colors).

// 2 mm width for the red and blue stripes on a 
// mailtruck at the 100mm length

// I used a hobby knife (like X-ACTO in the grooves to slice the tape.
// For other projects, set wid to the mm width you wish to use for slices of tape.
// even if the tape factory edge isn't lined up precisely, the other individual interior slices will be 140mm lengths of tape which is the right width.

wid=2;
difference(){
cube([100,140,5]);
for(k=[2:wid+1:100]){
    translate([k,-5,-.1])
    cube([1,160,2]);
}
